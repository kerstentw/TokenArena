It is called \"proof-of-PLAY&rdquo; and rewards every player, that plays the game GO on the public fa&ccedil;ade of the museum of modern arts in Graz Austria during the one month mining period, with virtual tokens (coins) for playing the game, no matter if they won or lost. For every valid move the players gets one token. Thus, this project puts the human at the centre of value creation, not machines. For every token mined, a supplement coin is generated to sell. These tokens are sold before and after the mining phase through an auction. 100% of the money raised is donated to non-profit-privacy organisations who do good work in the area of protection of privacy.", "links": [{"Website": "https://play.lab10.coop"}], "name": "PLAY", "symbol": "PLY", "token_logo": "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/2928.png"}, {"addr": "0xea1f346faf023f974eb5adaf088bbcdf02d761f4", "decimals": 18, "description": "Blocktix is an Ethereum based, counterfeit-resistant solution for individuals and event hosting businesses to distribute, advertise, and transfer ownership of event tickets or passes.", "links": [{"Blog": "http://blog.blocktix.io/"}, {"CoinMarketCap": "blocktix"}, {"Email": "mailto:info@blocktix.org"}, {"Github": "https://github.com/blocktix"}, {"Reddit": "https://reddit.com/r/blocktix"}, {"Slack": "https://slack.blocktix.io/"}, {"Twitter": "https://twitter.com/blocktix"}, {"Website": "https://blocktix.io/"}, {"Whitepaper": "https://blocktix.io/public/doc/blocktix-wp-draft.pdf#whitepaper"}], "name": "Blocktix", "symbol": "TIX", "token_logo": "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/1873.png"}, {"addr": "0x1d462414fe14cf489c7a21cac78509f4bf8cd7c0", "decimals": 6, "description": "CanYa is a peer to peer marketplace of skilled services - where users are instantly connected to service providers.", "links": [{"Blog": "https://blog.canya.com.au/"}, {"CoinMarketCap": "canyacoin"}, {"Email": "mailto:support@canya.com.au"}, {"Facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/CanYaapp/"}, {"Github": "https://github.com/CanYaCoinSale/"}, {"Reddit": "https://www.reddit.com/user/canya-io"}, {"Telegram": "https://t.me/canyacoin"}, {"Twitter": "https://twitter.com/canya_io"}, {"Website": "https://canya.io/"}, {"Whitepaper": "https://canya.io/assets/docs/WhitePaper.pdf"}], "name": "CanYaCoin", "symbol": "CAN", "token_logo": "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/2358.png"}, {"addr": "0xa8f93faee440644f89059a2c88bdc9bf3be5e2ea", "decimals": 18, "description": "Cash Poker Pro is a modern poker room with a network structure and a mechanism for fast and confidential money transfers based on the blockchain technology.", "links": [{"Bitcointalk": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2056999.0"}, {"Blog": "https://medium.com/@CashPokPro"}, {"Email": "mailto:cashppro@gmail.com"}, {"Facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/cashppro"}, {"Github": "https://github.com/cashpokerpro-dev/"}, {"Telegram": "https://t.me/cashpokerpro"}, {"Twitter": "https://twitter.com/CashPokPro"}, {"Website": "https://cashpokerpro.io/"}, {"Website": "https://cashpokerpro.io"}, {"Whitepaper": "https://cashpokerpro.io/whitepaper.pdf"}], "name": "Cash Poker Pro", "symbol": "CASH", "token_logo": "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/159.png"}, {"addr": "0xf8e386eda857484f5a12e4b5daa9984e06e73705", "decimals": 18, "description": "Indorse is a decentralized network for professionals, which rewards users for sharing their skills and indorsing the skills of others.", "links": [{"Blog": "https://medium.com/joinIndorse"}, {"CoinMarketCap": "indorse-token"}, {"Email": "mailto:info@indorse.io"}, {"Slack": "https://joinindorse.herokuapp.com/"}, {"Twitter": "https://twitter.com/joinIndorse"}, {"Website": "https://indorse.io/"}, {"Whitepaper": "https://indorse.io/static/media/Indorse-Whitepaper-v1.1.a733cc8e.pdf"}], "name": "Indorse Token", "symbol": "IND", "token_logo": "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/1967.png"}, {"addr": "0xf7b098298f7c69fc14610bf71d5e02c60792894c", "decimals": 3, "description": "Our vision is to build a platform for matchmakers by allowing anyone to create their own community &lsquo;pool&rsquo; for free and invite their members to their pool.
